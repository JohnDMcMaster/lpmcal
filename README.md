Laser power meter (LPM) calibration EEPROM tools

Mostly me just tinkering with Coherent/Molectron sensors to see if I could easily recalibrate them.
Unfortunately the data is a lot more complicated than I thought it might be, so not sure if this will be possible

That said:
* Coherent/Molectron J: most mature
    * My primary interest as I have nice J series meters + probes
    * Several variations. Some decode better than others
* Coherent/Molectron LM: unstable
* Coherent/Molectron PM: placeholder, but no work done
* Newport 835: unstable
    * Some interest as someone reverse engineered this already and I have several 835 meters
